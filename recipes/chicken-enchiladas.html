    <ol>
        <li>
            Place chicken into a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil
            over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until
            chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F
            (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle; shred chicken with
            with two forks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine sour cream, condensed soup, and chili powder in a saucepan. Bring to a
            simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat and cover
            to keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            At the same time, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and
            stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken, water, 1/2 of the
            green onions, green chiles, and taco seasoning; simer for 10 minutes. stir in lime
            juice, onion powder, and garlic powder; simmer for 10 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir 1 cup soup mixture into the skillet with the chicken. spread remaining soup
            mixture over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill each tortilla with 1/5 of the chicken mixture and about 5 tablespoons cheddar
            cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll tortillas around filling and place enchiladas, seam-side down, into the baking
            dish. Pour enchilada sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining cheddar, remaining
            green onions, and olives.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and cheese is melted and 
            bubbling, about 25 minutes.
